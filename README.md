# SQUIC - Sparse Quadratic Inverse Covariance Estimation

This repository hosts the SQUIC algorithm, made available for different software environments. In the subfolders there are respectively, SQUIC as an R-package, a Matlab library, a Python package and as a command line version. 

### Description

SQUIC tackles the statistical problem of estimating large sparse inverse covariance matrices. This estimation poses an ubiquitous problem that arises in many applications e.g. coming from the fields mathematical finance, geology and health. SQUIC belongs to the class of second-order L<sub>1</sub>-regularized Gaussian maximum likelihood methods and is especially suitable for high-dimensional datasets with limited number of samples. For further details please see the listed references.

\usage{
SQUIC(
  Y = NULL,
  lambda = 0,
  X_pattern = NULL,
  max_iter = 1,
  drop_tol = 1e-06,
  term_tol = 1e-06,

}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Input data, expects a matrix of dimension p x n, where each sample corresponds to one row of p random variables and a total number of n samples.}

\item{lambda}{Regularization parameter. Non-negative scalar. Each entry of X will be penalized in the same way with this value. Can be adapted for certain entries using the X_pattern parameter}

\item{X_pattern}{Optional matrix parameter that determines if certain entries in the inverse covariance matrix should be penalised differently. Needs to be given in coo format. See details for further information.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations.}

\item{drop_tol}{Drop out tolerance threshold. Defaults to 1e-6.}

\item{term_tol}{Terminal tolerence threshold. Defaults to 1e-6.}

\item{verbose}{Integer value. Defining the verbosity of the print statistics. The higher the value the more detailed the output gets. The value range is from: ... Defaults to zero.}

\item{X0}{Optional parameter. Matrix with a sparse initial guess of the inverse covariance matrix. Needs to be given in coo format. Defaults to the identity matrix.}

\item{W0}{Optional parameter. Matrix with a sparse initial guess of the covariance matrix. Needs to be given in coo format.Defaults to the identity matrix.}
}
\value{
X Estimated sparse inverse covariance matrix

W Estimated sparse inverse of the inverse covariance matrix
}
\description{
This function computes large Sparse Inverse Covariance Matrices quickly. 
It returns an estimate of the sparse covariance matrix W and its inverse X of a data matrix Y.
}
\details{
R version of SQUIC.
The higher the values are for lambda the more sparsity is enforced. Possible source of how to choose lambda?

Penalty terms: Each entry of the covariance is penalised by the scalar value lambda. In order to individually penalise a particular entry X_ij of the inverse covariance matrix the 
X_pattern matrix can be used. To not penalise an entry X_ij at all, one has to specify -lambda for this entry as the penalty term is internally computed as lambda * 1 * 1^T - X_pattern. 

The optional parameters X0 and W0 are for sparse initial guesses of X and W. 
They need to be given in COO-Format. Even though they are symmetric the all non-zero entries have to be specified. If no initial guess if known they will default to identity matrices.
